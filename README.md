# PhpMailer-with-gmail
I used php mailer and gmail in this form to redirect every input user put in the form to his gmail.
<br>
Steps to make it working <br>
<b>1-</b>Unzip PhpMailer-with-gmail.zip. <br>
<b>2-</b>You'll get the folder PhpMailer-with-gmail-master. <br>
<b>3-</b>open it and there will be to files index.php and send_mail.php.<br>
<b>4-</b>open send_mail.php and edit your gmail and password in the first wo fields.<br>
<b>5-</b>Now run the form from local host or by uploading it on the web server (If you dirtectly run it, form will open but mailing will not work out).<br>
<b>6-</b>when you first fill the form and submit you'll get notification on gmail that unsecure app is trying to login.<br>
<b>7-</b>open the mail and give it permission to login. <br>
<b>8-</b>And it's done. <br>
